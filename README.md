# Learning Jira. 

Let me explain Jira in a simple way, as if you're just starting your first software job:

Imagine Jira as a digital task board for your team's work, like a smart to-do list. Here's how you'll typically use it:

1. Your Daily Tasks
- You'll see tasks (called "issues" in Jira) assigned to you
- Each task will have details like what needs to be done, when it's due, and how important it is
- Think of it like getting assignments in your email, but more organized

2. Basic Things You'll Do:
- Check your tasks: Log in and click "Assigned to me" to see your work
- Update status: Move tasks from "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Done"
- Add comments: Let others know what you're working on or if you need help
- Log time: Record how long you spent on tasks

3. Common Screens You'll See:
- Board View: Like a digital whiteboard with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Backlog: List of all upcoming work
- Your Dashboard: Shows your tasks and recent activity

4. Basic Terms You'll Hear:
- Story: A feature or piece of work that needs to be done
- Bug: Something that needs to be fixed
- Sprint: A set time period (usually 2 weeks) to complete specific tasks
- Epic: A big task that's broken down into smaller tasks

5. Common Actions You'll Take:
```
- Creating a task: Click "Create" → Fill in details → Assign
- Moving a task: Drag and drop between columns
- Adding comments: Click on task → Add comment
- Attaching files: Click paperclip icon → Upload screenshots or documents
```

6. Tips for Beginners:
- Always update your task status so your team knows what you're working on
- If stuck, add a comment mentioning your team member (@their-name)
- Check Jira first thing in your workday to see your tasks
- Don't worry about advanced features initially - focus on basic task management

Example of Your Daily Routine:
1. Morning: Log in, check your assigned tasks
2. Start work: Move task to "In Progress"
3. During work: Add comments about your progress
4. Finish task: Move to "Done", add final comments
5. Repeat with next task
