# Learning Jira. 

Let me explain Jira in a simple way, as if you're just starting your first software job:

Imagine Jira as a digital task board for your team's work, like a smart to-do list. Here's how you'll typically use it:

1. Your Daily Tasks
- You'll see tasks (called "issues" in Jira) assigned to you
- Each task will have details like what needs to be done, when it's due, and how important it is
- Think of it like getting assignments in your email, but more organized

2. Basic Things You'll Do:
- Check your tasks: Log in and click "Assigned to me" to see your work
- Update status: Move tasks from "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Done"
- Add comments: Let others know what you're working on or if you need help
- Log time: Record how long you spent on tasks

3. Common Screens You'll See:
- Board View: Like a digital whiteboard with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Backlog: List of all upcoming work
- Your Dashboard: Shows your tasks and recent activity

4. Basic Terms You'll Hear:
- Story: A feature or piece of work that needs to be done
- Bug: Something that needs to be fixed
- Sprint: A set time period (usually 2 weeks) to complete specific tasks
- Epic: A big task that's broken down into smaller tasks

5. Common Actions You'll Take:
```
- Creating a task: Click "Create" → Fill in details → Assign
- Moving a task: Drag and drop between columns
- Adding comments: Click on task → Add comment
- Attaching files: Click paperclip icon → Upload screenshots or documents
```

6. Tips for Beginners:
- Always update your task status so your team knows what you're working on
- If stuck, add a comment mentioning your team member (@their-name)
- Check Jira first thing in your workday to see your tasks
- Don't worry about advanced features initially - focus on basic task management

Example of Your Daily Routine:
1. Morning: Log in, check your assigned tasks
2. Start work: Move task to "In Progress"
3. During work: Add comments about your progress
4. Finish task: Move to "Done", add final comments
5. Repeat with next task

Let me break down each of these fundamental Jira concepts in simple terms:

1. Issue
- Think of an issue as a single work item or task
- It could be anything: a bug to fix, a feature to build, or a task to complete
- Example: "Create login page" or "Fix homepage loading bug"

2. Issue Types
Common types include:
- Story: A new feature or requirement
- Bug: Something that needs fixing
- Task: General work item
- Epic: A large body of work containing many issues
- Subtask: Smaller pieces of a larger issue

3. Status
Shows where an issue is in its lifecycle:
- To Do: Not started yet
- In Progress: Currently being worked on
- In Review: Being checked/tested
- Done: Completed
Note: Your team might have custom statuses like "Blocked" or "Testing"

4. Fields
These are information boxes in each issue:
- Summary: Brief description
- Description: Detailed explanation
- Assignee: Person responsible
- Reporter: Person who created the issue
- Priority: How urgent it is
- Due Date: When it needs to be done
- Comments: Team discussions
- Attachments: Related files/images

5. Projects
- A container for related issues
- Example: "Mobile App Development" or "Website Redesign"
- Each project can have its own:
  * Team members
  * Settings
  * Workflows
  * Issue types

6. Workflow
- Defines how an issue moves from start to finish
- Basic workflow example:
```
To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
```
- Can include rules like:
  * Who can move issues to specific statuses
  * What fields must be filled before status changes
  * What happens automatically when status changes

7. Boards
- Visual representations of your work
- Two main types:
  * Scrum Board: For sprint-based work
  * Kanban Board: For continuous flow of work
- Shows issues in columns based on status
- Lets you drag and drop issues between statuses

8. Dashboards
- Customizable homepage showing important information
- Can include:
  * Your assigned issues
  * Recent activity
  * Project statistics
  * Custom reports and graphs
  * Team workload
- Can create multiple dashboards for different purposes

9. Filters
- Ways to search and save specific views of issues
- Examples:
  * "My open issues"
  * "High-priority bugs"
  * "Tasks due this week"
- Can be used to:
  * Create reports
  * Share specific views with team
  * Set up board columns
  * Create dashboard gadgets

Practical Example:
Let's say you're working on a website project:
1. Project: "Website Redesign"
2. Epic: "User Authentication System"
3. Story: "Create Login Page"
4. Subtasks:
   - Design login form
   - Implement form validation
   - Add password reset feature
5. Status: Moves through your workflow
6. Board: Shows all these items visually
7. Dashboard: Shows progress and metrics
8. Filter: "Show all authentication-related tasks"

Common Use Flow:
1. Open your dashboard
2. Check your assigned issues
3. Use board to update status
4. Apply filters to find specific issues
5. Update fields as you work
6. Follow the workflow
7. Complete tasks according to project guidelines
